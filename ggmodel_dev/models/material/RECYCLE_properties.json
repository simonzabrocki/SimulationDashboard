        "description": "The material use efficiency model is a top-down, inflow driven model of material stocks and flows. The model focuses on materials used for the build-up and maintenance of the economic system such as metals, non-metallic minerals and a small proportion of biomass and fossil fuel carriers. Domestic material consumption is the main exogenous input variable that drives the model. After considering lifecycle phases such as processing and manufacturing, the remaining materials are considered as inflow to the material stock. Material outflows are calculated per year by applying a lifetime distribution function, with recycled material flows being determined by multiplying outflow by a defined recycling rate. Waste to landfill flows are calculated as the difference between material outflows and recycled materials. Based on the principle of mass balance, the change in material stock is calculated by the difference in inflows and outflows. Accumulating the change in material stock for all previous years until time â€˜tâ€™ provides an estimate on the total material stock. Understanding the various material stock and flows can be useful in assessing the relationship between the accumulation of materials in socio-economic systems, the services these long-term stocks provide and the contribution to solid waste and greenhouse gas emissions.",
