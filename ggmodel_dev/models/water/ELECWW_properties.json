        "description": "This model is focused on total annual thermoelectric power water withdrawal. Gridded-based spatial analysis is conducted so spatial distribution of industrial water demand can be investigated.  For calculation of this model, fuel type, cooling system and annual electricity produced of each power plant are considered. Whereas fuel type information is fully provided with database, cooling type and electricity generation donâ€™t have enough information in database. So, for electricity generation, total generation and aggregated capacity of all plants by fuel type and country are used for assuming missing values. Also, other instituteâ€™s research and each countryâ€™s government report are referred for better data quality.  And as cooling system relies on volumes of nearby discharge, volumes of discharge and electricity production of surrounding area is considered for estimating the type of cooling system.",
