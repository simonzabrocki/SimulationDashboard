        "description": "The model is computes the annual thermo electric power water withdrawal. The water withdrawal depends on fuel and cooling system.  The fuel type is provided directly in the input data. The cooling system is estimated with geospatial analysis, the estimation takes into account nearby discharge as well as electricity production.
