        "description": "The electricity and heat production sector contribute the most amount of CO2 emissions across the world [1]. The intensity of CO2 emissions is proportional to the amount of fossil fuels burned in the power plants. The emissions from fossil fuel power plants are calculated using the methodologies suggested by the Asian Development Bank on estimating greenhouse gas emissions [2]. The emissions are driven by population growth, and an increase in electricity demand from various sectors",
